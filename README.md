Based on information about users such as age, daily internet usage and time spent on the website using a logistic model try and predict whether or not a given user will click on an advertisement. This can be very useful to any company who is trying to increase their brand and flow of consumers to their product. A model such as this one can help them see what works or what doesnt work and how to better target people who they want to sell their prodcuts to.

The project starts off with some data exploration and data visualization to better see what the data looks like and if there are any trends I can easily pick up on. There is a little bit of data processing and creating dummy variables to prepare the data for the logistic regression. The data is then split into testing and training data and then the model is trained. With the help of some of the sklearn metric functions we can evaluate our model as having an accuracy of 93% which is good.
